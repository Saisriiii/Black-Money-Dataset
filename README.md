This paper presents an analysis of comprising 
irregular financial transactions with a focus on identifying 
potential cases of money laundering. Using data pre
processing techniques and machine learning algorithms 
such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes, the study 
attempts to classify transactions based on their risk levels. 
The study aims to uncover patterns and correlations 
between transaction types, countries involved, and the risk 
of money laundering.
